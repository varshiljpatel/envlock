Managing `.env` files in modern applications can be cumbersome and error-prone. Developers often face challenges such as:

- Accidentally committing sensitive `.env` files to version control.
- Manually managing `.env` files across multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Lack of encryption for `.env` files, leaving sensitive data exposed.

These issues can lead to security vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and unnecessary complexity in managing environment variables.
