Envlock is a CLI tool designed to simplify and secure the management of `.env` files. With Envlock, you can:

- **Encrypt** your `.env` files into `env.lock` files, ensuring sensitive data is protected.
- **Decrypt** `env.lock` files back into `.env` files when needed.
- Specify custom paths and filenames for `.env` and `env.lock` files.
- Automatically update your `.gitignore` file to exclude `.env` files from version control.

Envlock ensures that your environment variables are secure and easy to manage across different environments.
